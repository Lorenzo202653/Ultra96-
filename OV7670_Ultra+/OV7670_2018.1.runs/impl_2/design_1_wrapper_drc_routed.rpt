PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/OV7670_GRAYSCALE_TO_AXIS/ov7670_interface_0/inst/frame_valid_V[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/OV7670_GRAYSCALE_TO_AXIS/ov7670_interface_0/inst/frame_valid_V[0]_INST_0/O, cell design_1_i/OV7670_GRAYSCALE_TO_AXIS/ov7670_interface_0/inst/frame_valid_V[0]_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-58#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Sub-optimal placement for a global clock-capable IO pin and BUFG pair.
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The global clock-capable IO (GCIO) is placed on a GCIO capable site (b) The BUFG is placed in the same bank of the device as the GCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	PCLK_IBUF_inst/IBUFCTRL_INST (in PCLK_IBUF_inst macro) (IBUFCTRL.O) is locked to D6
	PCLK_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFGCE.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCE_HDIO_X0Y0
